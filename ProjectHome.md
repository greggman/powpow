This is a simple locally multiplayer game written entirely in `JavaScript`.

The a relay runs in node.js. All it does is relay messages to/from the game server and the clients.

The game server runs in the browser on one machine preferably connected to a large display.

Players connect using any browser (laptop, mobile) that supports websockets. (Chrome 15+)
